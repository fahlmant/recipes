1 half onion
2-3 stalks of celery
1 half bell pepper
1-2 jalapeno

Dice all vegetables before continuing
Chop up andouille sausage (just a bit more than the chicken)
Mince 4-6 cloves of garlic

Put 1 large chicken breast or 2-3 chicken thighs in cast iron skillet. Olive oil, salt and pepper on both sides. Turn heat to medium. Goal is to sear both sides, so don't forget to turn over at some point.

½ cup oil into dutch oven, turn on heat and wait until starting to smoke
½ cup flour into oil. 

Stir constantly until slurry turns color of Hershey's chocolate bar. DO NOT STOP STIRRING OR YOU WILL BURN IT

Once roux is done, add the vegetables immediately, except garlic. Add a pinch of salt and stir all together.

Check chicken, put a bit of beer to deglaze.

Now that veggies have calmed down, add garlic. Stir for another minute or until onions are translucent.

Add around a cup of beer. Stir vigorously. 

Slowly pour in quart of chicken stock and stir at the same time. 

Add chicken and gravy. Add 3-4 bay leaves, teaspoon of thyme, pinch of salt, 30 cracks of fresh pepper (yes thirty, it's not a typo). Add andouille. 

Stir well, put heat to medium high until simmering. Then turn heat low and put lid on. Stir every 10-15 minutes. 

Let cook for about 3 hours at least. 

Serve with rice and green onions
